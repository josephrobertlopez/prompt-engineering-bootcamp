OVERVIEW
--------
For FY26, Accenture requires all employees (all career levels) to set ONE priority in EACH of the four strategic categories. These priorities align with Accenture's two-part strategy: to be the reinvention partner of choice for clients and to be the most client-focused, AI-enabled, great place to work for reinventors in the world.

THE FOUR FY26 PRIORITY CATEGORIES
----------------------------------

1. CLIENT VALUE CREATION
   Definition: How you create/contribute to success for our clients by delivering 360° value, building and nurturing trusted key client relationships and creating a collaborative and exceptional client experience.
   
   This includes:
   • Delivering tangible business outcomes at clients with our partners (measured through Client NPS, client value meter, and/or public credentials)
   • Innovating & sharing knowledge for the good of all clients, by publishing thought leadership, developing practice or industry offerings and contributing to the Reinvention Console

2. AI ENABLEMENT
   Definition: How you use AI individually, how you develop your AI skills and those of your team, and how, depending on your role, you embed AI into offerings, assets, and processes at our clients and Accenture.

3. GREAT PLACE TO WORK FOR REINVENTORS
   Definition: How you create/contribute to exceptional teams.
   
   This includes:

   • Understanding engagement through Q12, building an action plan and executing on that plan
   • Create experiences where every person feels heard, recognized, understands our mission and purpose
   • Build a culture that encourages collaboration, celebrates innovation, reinvention & inspires high performance
   • Lead by example through mentorship, team engagement, ERG membership or other Accenture communities

ABCD REFLECTION FRAMEWORK
--------------------------
The ABCD reflection is how you document your accomplishments and impact throughout the year. It's critical for performance reviews and promotion decisions.

A - ACCOMPLISHMENTS (What You Did)
   • What specific actions did you take?
   • What did you deliver or complete?
   • What milestones did you achieve?
   • Be specific with examples and timeframes
   
   Example: "Led development and deployment of custom AI analytics dashboard using Azure ML and Power BI. Delivered 3 months ahead of schedule with zero critical bugs."

B - BUSINESS IMPACT (Value Created)
   • How did your work create value for clients?
   • What measurable results did you achieve?
   • How did you contribute to team/project success?
   • Include metrics, percentages, client feedback
   
   Example: "Reduced client's monthly reporting cycle from 5 days to 2 days (60% improvement). Client NPS increased from 7 to 9. Generated $500K in additional revenue opportunities."

C - CHALLENGES OVERCOME (Obstacles Navigated)
   • What obstacles or constraints did you face?
   • How did you navigate difficulties?
   • What creative solutions did you develop?
   • How did you demonstrate resilience?
   
   Example: "Overcame initial data quality issues by implementing automated data cleansing pipeline. Navigated stakeholder resistance by conducting 8 workshops demonstrating ROI."

D - DEVELOPMENT & LEARNING (Skills Gained)
   • What new skills or knowledge did you gain?
   • How did you grow professionally?
   • What tools or technologies did you master?
   • How did you contribute to others' development?
   
   Example: "Earned Azure AI Engineer certification. Mastered Power BI advanced analytics. Developed presentation skills through client workshops. Mentored 2 junior analysts."

REFLECTION WRITING BEST PRACTICES
----------------------------------
1. Be specific with real examples from your work
2. Quantify impact wherever possible (%, $, time saved)
3. Use STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result
4. Connect to priority categories and metrics
5. Update reflections regularly (quarterly recommended)
6. Focus on YOUR contributions, not just team achievements
7. Highlight innovation, collaboration, and leadership
8. Be honest and authentic - avoid exaggeration
9. Include both successes and learning experiences
10. Make it easy for reviewers to see your value

WHY ABCD REFLECTIONS MATTER
----------------------------
• They serve as documentation of your yearly contributions
• Reviewers use them to assess performance and promotion readiness
• Strong reflections with significant project impact lead to better appraisals
• They help you remember your accomplishments during review discussions
• They demonstrate your ability to articulate business value
• They show your growth trajectory and learning mindset

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
• Some priorities below may still be mapped to old FY25 categories. If a priority should remain "in progress" in FY26, edit and select one of the new categories.
• When completing priorities, you may be prompted to update the category if the completed-on date is in FY26 and you selected an FY25 completed-on date.
• Priorities set the foundation for feedback and reflections, displayed front and center in talent discussions
• You can Edit or click the ellipses to self-reflect and view a summary of requested and received reflections

TIMELINE
--------
• Set priorities early in FY26 (typically by October/November)
• Update reflections quarterly throughout the year
• Complete final reflections before year-end review cycle
• Discuss with manager during 1:1s and formal reviews

SYSTEM ACCESS
-------------
• Access priorities through Workday at: wd103.myworkday.com/accenture
