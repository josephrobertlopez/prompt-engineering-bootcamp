## 🎯 THE 5 PROMPT MODES EXPLAINED

### **Mode 1: Constitution** 🎼
**What:** Project rules and constraints that apply everywhere  
**When to write:** Once per project  
**Reusability:** Use for all files in project  
**Think of it as:** Project DNA or Sheet Music

**For Spring Migration:**
- javax → jakarta
- @RequestMapping → HTTP method annotations
- Security patterns
- Exception handling rules

---

### **Mode 2: Specification** 🎯
**What:** Describes WHAT to build/change in THIS file  
**When to write:** Once per file (5 min)  
**Reusability:** Template reusable, customize per file  
**Think of it as:** The Blueprint

**For Spring Migration:**
- Current state (Spring 2.7 patterns)
- Target state (Spring 3.2 patterns)
- Success criteria
- Before code

---

### **Mode 3: Planning** 📋
**What:** HOW to execute step-by-step  
**When to write:** Once per pattern type  
**Reusability:** Same plan for similar files  
**Think of it as:** The Recipe

**For Spring Migration:**
- Phase 1: Packages
- Phase 2: Annotations
- Phase 3: Configuration
- Phase 4: Testing

---

### **Mode 4: ABCD Clarification** 🤔
**What:** Decision points where you choose approach  
**When to write:** When ambiguity exists  
**Reusability:** Document decisions for team  
**Think of it as:** Decision Checkpoints

**For Spring Migration:**
- Security config: Default vs Custom
- Exception handling: Simple vs Detailed
- Validation approach

---

### **Mode 5: Implementation** ⚙️
**What:** Combines all context, generates code  
**When to write:** Every file (but fast - 2 min)  
**Reusability:** Template stays same, just update file reference  
**Think of it as:** The Performance

**For Spring Migration:**
- References modes 1-4
- Includes before code
- Clear generation instructions
- AI produces clean Spring 3 code

2. Everyone clones Spring 2→3 repo
3. Load pre-built workflow (file-0 through file-4)
4. Migrate 2 controllers
5. Homework: Pick file for tomorrow

**Day 2 (1.5 hours):**
1. Present using DAY-2-SESSION-GUIDE.md
2. Everyone writes their own 5-mode workflow
3. Test on their chosen Spring file
4. Share workflows with team
5. Track time savings

**Total time investment:** 3 hours  
**Payoff:** Team migrates 20+ files this month (13+ hours saved)

---

### **Option B: Self-Paced Learning**

---

### **Option C: Quick Template Use**
1. Skip theory
2. Copy file-0-constitution.md (modify for your project)
3. Use templates to create files 1-4
4. Run workflow
5. Iterate

**Time:** 30 min setup, 5 min per file after  
**Result:** Fast migration automation

## 💡 KEY INNOVATIONS

### **1. 5 Modes as Thinking Framework**
Not just "here are some templates." The modes teach YOU how to think systematically about AI collaboration.

**Traditional approach:**
```
You → "Migrate this to Spring 3"
AI → [random changes]
You → "That's not right"
AI → [different random changes]
[45 minutes of frustration]
```

**5-Mode approach:**
```
You → Load Constitution (rules)
You → Load Specification (target)
You → Load Planning (approach)
You → Make ABCD decisions (control)
AI → Generates perfect code
[5 minutes, done]
```

---

### **2. Integrated with [redacted reference]**
Your materials now bridge:
- **Your prompt-engineering-demo** (4 core techniques)
- **[redacted reference]** (5 modes + Spec-Kit workflow)
- **Capital One context** (Java Spring migration)

**The connection:**
- 4 techniques = Building blocks
- 5 modes = Orchestration framework
- Spring migration = Real application

---

### **3. Java Spring Focus**
Not generic examples. Real Spring 2→3 migration patterns:
- javax → jakarta
- @RequestMapping → @GetMapping
- WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter → SecurityFilterChain
- Exception handling with ProblemDetail

**Uses your actual repo** with before/after branches.

---

### **4. Progressive Complexity**
- **Day 1:** Run pre-built workflow (understand)
- **Day 2:** Write your own workflow (create)
- **Week 1:** Use for multiple files (practice)
- **Month 1:** Build team library (scale)

---

### **5. Measurable Impact**
Built-in tracking:
- First file: 30 min setup
- Every file after: 5 min
- Manual migration: 45-60 min per file
- **Savings: 40 min per file**
- **20 files/month: 13+ hours saved**

Perfect for FY26 Performance Achievement documentation.
