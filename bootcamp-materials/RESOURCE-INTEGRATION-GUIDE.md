2. **Production patterns** ([redacted reference] learnings)
3. **Specialized bootcamp** (Capital One data engineering focus)
4. **Integration strategy** (this document)
5. **Clear path forward** (Day 1 → Advanced)

**The hard part isn't creating materials. The hard part is:**
- Getting team to actually use them
- Measuring impact systematically
- Evolving based on feedback
- Maintaining momentum over time

**That's why this is LIVING documentation.**

Update it every week. Even if small changes. Keep it relevant. Make it better. Let your team shape it.
