# Project Knowledge Base

**Location**: spec/knowledge-base.md
**Created**: [Date]
**Last Updated**: [Date]

**First time?** Start with:
1. **Constraints** - What can't we change? (databases, APIs, compliance)
2. **Domain Concepts** - What jargon needs defining?
3. **Architectural Principles** - What patterns do we follow?

**Small project?** Start with just Constraints + Domain Concepts. Add sections as needed.

---

## Domain Concepts

Business terms that might confuse developers. Define once, reference everywhere.

- [Term]: [Definition]
- [Term]: [Definition]

## Architectural Principles

Patterns we follow and why. Helps AI stay consistent with project style.

- Pattern: [Name and rationale]
- Anti-patterns: [What to avoid]

## System Context

External systems and infrastructure we integrate with.

- Infrastructure: [Description]
- Integrations: [List]

## Past Decisions

Previous technical decisions and their rationale (ADR-style).

- [Decision]: [Rationale] (Date: [When])
- [Decision]: [Rationale] (Date: [When])

## Constraints

**MUST-FOLLOW** limitations. Most critical section.

- Technical: [Database version, language version, APIs we must use]
- Regulatory: [GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 requirements]
- Organizational: [Team size, timeline, budget]

## Lessons Learned

What we learned from previous projects or iterations.

- [What we learned and how it affects this project]
