## 🟢🟡🟠 Three-Tier Maturity Framework

This workshop teaches prompt engineering through a maturity lens:

- **🟢 Tier 1 (10+ years):** ADRs, RFCs, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, Persona, Template patterns
- **🟡 Tier 2 (1-3 years):** .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md
- **🟠 Tier 3 (months-2 years):** GitHub Spec-Kit, structured file workflows

**Key Philosophy:** Multiple approaches are valid. Choose based on team maturity and task complexity.
